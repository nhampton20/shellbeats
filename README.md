# shellbeats

![shellbeats](shellbeats.jpg)

A terminal music player for Linux. Search YouTube and stream audio directly from your command line.

Note: The code currently has some Italian strings mixed in. I started this project for personal use, then decided to publish it. Future updates will be fully in English.

## Why?

I wrote this because I use a tiling window manager and I got tired of:
- Managing clunky music player windows that break my workflow
- Keeping browser tabs open with YouTube eating up RAM
- Getting distracted by video recommendations when I just want to listen to music

shellbeats stays in the terminal where it belongs. Search, play, done.

## How it works

```
┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│  shellbeats  │ ───> │    yt-dlp    │ ───> │     mpv      │
│   (ncurses)  │      │   (search)   │      │  (playback)  │
└──────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

1. You search for something
2. yt-dlp fetches results from YouTube
3. mpv streams the audio (nothing saved to disk)

## Dependencies

- `mpv` - audio playback
- `yt-dlp` - YouTube search and streaming
